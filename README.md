# RoundedProgressBar
A customizable, animated progress bar that features rounded corners. This Android library is designed to be no-frills and simple to use ðŸŽ‰

# Gradle Setup
If you don't have this already, add it to your *root* build.gradle file:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Then you can add the dependency to your *app* build.gradle file:
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.MackHartley:RoundedProgressBar:Tag'
}
```
